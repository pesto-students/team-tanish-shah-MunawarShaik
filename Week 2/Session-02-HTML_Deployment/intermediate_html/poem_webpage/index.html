        I'm Nobody! Who are you? <br />
        Are You - Nobody - Too? <br />
        Then there's a pair of us! <br />
        Don't tell! They'd banish us - you Know!

      <p>
        How dreary - to be - Somebody! <br />
        How public - like a Frog - <br />
        To tell one's name - livelong June - <br />
        TO an admiring Bog!
