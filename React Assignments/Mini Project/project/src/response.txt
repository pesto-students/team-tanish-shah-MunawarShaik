Here's a beginner workout plan for a 20-year-old male with a duration of 15 minutes:

Warm-up (5 minutes)
- Jog in place: 2 minutes
- Jumping jacks: 1 minute
- Arm circles: 1 minute
- Leg swings: 1 minute

Circuit Training (10 minutes)
Perform each exercise for 30 seconds, with a 15-second rest between exercises. Complete the circuit twice.

1. Bodyweight Squats: Stand with feet hip-width apart. Bend your knees and lower your hips down towards the ground, keeping your chest up and core engaged.
Rest for 15 seconds.

2. Push-ups: Start in a high plank position with hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Lower your body down, keeping your elbows close to your sides, then push back up.
Rest for 15 seconds.

3. Mountain climbers: Start in a high plank position. Alternate driving your knees towards your chest, as if you were climbing a mountain.
Rest for 15 seconds.

4. Plank: Start in a forearm plank position, with your elbows under your shoulders and core engaged. Hold the position, maintaining a straight line from head to toes.
Rest for 15 seconds.

5. High knees: Stand with feet hip-width apart. Drive one knee up towards your chest, while hopping on the opposite foot. Alternate quickly between legs.
Rest for 15 seconds.

Cooldown (2 minutes)
- Walking in place: 1 minute
- Stretching: 1 minute (focus on stretching the major muscle groups of the body)

Note: As your fitness level improves, aim to increase the duration of your workouts gradually. You can also repeat the circuit more than twice to extend the duration of the workout. Always listen to your body and make sure to maintain proper form during each exercise.
